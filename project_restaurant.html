                              <span class="span4">1) Tasty Food</span><br><br>
                              Invariably the food is tasty and well prepared. The fare is appropriate for the price point and market it’s aimed at. It’s essential that patrons feel they’ve had a good, enjoyable meal.<br>
                              
                             <span class="span4"> 2) Range of Beverages</span><br><br>
                              A successful restaurant offers a good range of beverages that cater for different tastes. Although more complex to organize, it certainly pleases customers who want variety. Good restaurants stock popular cordials, wines, spirits and beers and avoid cheaper brands of dubious quality.<br>
                              
                              
                             <span class="span4"> 3) Good Service</span><br><br>
                              Waitrons know thdeir jobs, are efficient and able to advise customers on the best choices. Food is served with minimal delay, and after the meal patrons don’t have to struggle to get their bill.<br>
                              
                              <span class="span4">4) Hospitable Atmosphere</span><br><br>
                              The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. If music is played, it’s appropriate and the volume not so loud that customers cannot talk. Staff is trained to avoid distracting behaviour and making unnecessary noise.<br>
                              
                              <span class="span4">5) Reasonable Cost</span><br><br>
                              Restaurants have different price points, but the golden rule is that customers should feel that the cost of their meal was fair and reasonable, even in high-end establishments. Avoid overcharging.<br>
                              
                             <span class="span4"> 6) Convenient Location</span><br><br>
                              The restaurant location must be appropriate. A successful fast food restaurant should be in a popular mall, whereas a sophisticated restaurant would be located in an up-market area that’s easy to access. Adequate parking for patrons should always be provided.<br>
                              
                              <span class="span4">7) Culinary Expertise</span><br><br>
                              Chefs are chosen for their culinary skills and inventiveness. This applies equally to high-end and budget restaurants. Equally, restaurant management are passionate about food, participate in selecting menus and are customer orientated. Management and staff have appropriate culinary knowledge.<br>
                              
                              <span class="span4">8) Hygiene and Cleanliness</span><br><rb>
                              The entire facility is kept spotlessly clean. Eating areas should be wiped clean frequently because nothing puts patrons off as much as a dirty table. Proper food storage and preparation standards are followed to reduce the risk of spoiling food and to eliminate the risk of incidents that could damage the restaurant’s reputation.<br>
                              
                    <span class="span4">9) Management Skills</span><br>
                              The management team of a successful restaurant is well trained and understands the need to balance selling prices along with food preparation, labour costs and overhead costs. They demonstrate really good people management skills, understanding that happy staff means happy customers.<br>
                              
                              <span class="span4">10) The Overall Experience</span><br>
                              The goal of a successful restaurant is to provide clients with an excellent overall experience that draws them back again and again. This means that everything is focused on enhancing the customer’s experience<br></h4>
